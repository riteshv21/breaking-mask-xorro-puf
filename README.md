## Introduction

XORRO is a lightweight encryption algorithm that operates exclusively using the XOR (exclusive OR) operation. It has gained attention for its simplicity and computational efficiency in certain scenarios. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the XORRO algorithm, its design principles, and its security properties through analysis and experimentation.

In this repository, you will find the source code for implementing linear machine learning models to crack the XORRO algorithm.
## Installation

To get started with the XORRO project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/divc13/Uncovering-the-Mask-of-XORRO.git
   ```

2. Ensure that you have a compatible version of Python (e.g., Python 3.7 or above) installed on your system.


Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to explore different aspects of the linear model to crack the XORRO algorithm. Make sure to refer to the accompanying documentation for a detailed explanation of the algorithm's inner workings.
